**üí° Abstract**

In this talk, I will delve into the next frontier of software development: the integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models into the developer workflow. We'll explore initial experiments with AI powered code review in open source repositories at Slack.

I will provide a detailed examination of these experiments‚Äîdiscussing the benefits, challenges, and future opportunities of strategic bets in this space. This includes an exploration of how these technologies can be tailored to various developer workflows, ranging from automated testing to code comprehension, all while maintaining the human-in-the-loop principle.

My motivation for this talk is rooted in my commitment to advancing technologies that empower developers to make better decisions. I believe AI powered developer tools present tremendous leverage for engineers across a variety of developer workflows.

- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08302](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08302) - This study presents a roadmap for unifying Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), emphasizing the complementary nature of LLMs' generalizability and KGs' structured factual knowledge. The proposed unification consists of three frameworks: KG-enhanced LLMs for improved understanding and inference, LLM-augmented KGs for diverse tasks like construction and question answering, and Synergized LLMs + KGs that combine both in a mutually beneficial way to enhance bidirectional reasoning.

The paper introduces CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at Meta, based on the InCoder LLM, which has been scaled to serve tens of thousands of developers across multiple languages. It outlines the unique challenges of large-scale industrial deployment, design decisions, and metrics from its use, highlighting a 22% acceptance rate for suggestions and 91.5% positive reception, along with additional positive side effects like encouraging more in-code documentation and API discovery.
